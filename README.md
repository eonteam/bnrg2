## Note

The folder `usr_config` contains the file `bluenrg_conf.h` that is used to configure some parameters in BlueNRG2 (for example the Minimum/Maximum Advertising Interval), however we are not exposing them, we are just providing the defaults (should we expose them?). Only the `BLUENRG_PRINTF` can be selected how to work using the macro `BNRG2_LL_DEBUG`.
